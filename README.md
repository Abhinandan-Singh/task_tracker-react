# Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Setup

### Install Node and npm

Install the latest LTS version available of NodeJS. I am using version - 14.18.1 and npm v6.14.15
Check version with the following commands : 

`node -v`

`npm -v`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Runs the local JSON Server to act as your database for this app.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
